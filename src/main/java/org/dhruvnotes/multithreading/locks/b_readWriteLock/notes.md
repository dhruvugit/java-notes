# ReadWriteLock in Java

## Overview
- `ReadWriteLock` is part of `java.util.concurrent.locks` and provides better concurrency than a standard `ReentrantLock`.
- It allows multiple threads to read simultaneously but ensures only one thread can write at a time.

## Key Components
1. **Read Lock (`readLock()`)**
    - Multiple threads can acquire a read lock at the same time.
    - Reading operations do not block each other.
    - Blocks writers from acquiring the lock while reading is in progress.

2. **Write Lock (`writeLock()`)**
    - Only one thread can acquire a write lock at a time.
    - While a thread holds the write lock, no other thread can read or write.
    - Ensures exclusive access to prevent data inconsistency.

## How It Works
- When **only reads** are happening, multiple threads can acquire the read lock without blocking.
- If a **write operation** is requested, it must wait until all read locks are released.
- While a **write lock** is held, all read and write operations are blocked.

## Advantages Over `synchronized`
| Feature | `synchronized` | `ReadWriteLock` |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Concurrency | Blocks all other threads | Allows multiple readers |
| Read Efficiency | Low if multiple reads occur | High due to shared read lock |
| Flexibility | No fine-grained control | Separate read and write locks |
| Performance | Less efficient for high-read scenarios | Optimized for read-heavy workloads |

## Use Cases
- **Caching mechanisms** where multiple threads read frequently but write infrequently.
- **File readers** that allow multiple readers but restrict write access.
- **Data structures like maps and lists** shared between multiple threads.

## Best Practices
- Use `readLock()` for frequent read operations to improve performance.
- Use `writeLock()` when modifying shared data.
- Always release locks in a `finally` block to prevent deadlocks.
- Avoid unnecessary locking to improve efficiency.

## Summary
- `ReadWriteLock` improves concurrency in read-heavy applications.
- It distinguishes between read and write operations, allowing better thread management.
- Proper use of `readLock()` and `writeLock()` ensures data consistency while maximizing parallelism.
