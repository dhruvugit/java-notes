Absolutely! Here's a set of concise and clear **short notes on abstract class concepts**:

---

### 🔹 **Abstract Class – Basics**
- Cannot be instantiated directly.
- Can have both **abstract methods** (without body) and **concrete methods** (with body).
- Used when you want to **provide a base class with partial implementation**.

---

### 🔹 **Why Use Abstract Class?**
- To define **common structure and behavior** for subclasses.
- To enforce a **contract** (via abstract methods) while allowing **code reuse** (via concrete methods).
- Ideal when subclasses **share state** or logic.

### 🔹 **Abstract Class vs Interface**
| Feature            | Abstract Class            | Interface                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Inheritance        | One only (single)         | Multiple interfaces allowed      |
| Constructors       | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No                            |
| Fields             | ✅ Yes (instance vars)    | ⚠️ Only static + final           |
| Method Types       | Abstract + Concrete       | Abstract, Default, Static, Private |
| Use Case           | "Is-a" with common logic  | Pure contract / capability       |

### 🔹 **Abstract Class Constructor**
- **Allowed** even though the class can't be instantiated directly.
- Used to **initialize shared fields**.
- Called when a **child class** is instantiated using `super()`.

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    String licenseNumber;
    Vehicle(String licenseNumber) {
        this.licenseNumber = licenseNumber;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 **When to Choose Abstract Class**
- When objects **share common state/fields**.
- When base class should **control part of the subclass behavior**.
- When enforcing **base logic with flexibility** for specialization.
